# Machine Learning In Real World
*files of the exercises of my first year machine learning course at the University of Cambridge*

## Folders and What They Contain

2. Hidden States Prediction (Markov Model)
- `exercises`: code that I wrote for the exercises(we call it 'ticks')  
- `utils`: code for utility, such as graph sketching and printing matrices
