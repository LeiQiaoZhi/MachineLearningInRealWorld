# Machine Learning In Real World
*files of the exercises of my first year machine learning course at the University of Cambridge*

## Folders and What They Contain
- `data`: training, validation and testing data for two tasks:
	1. Sentiment Classification (NLP)
	2. Hidden States Prediction (Markov Model)
- `exercises`: code that I wrote for the exercises(we call it 'ticks')  
- `utils`: code for utility, such as graph sketching and printing matrices

### Tick 4
Task: Sign test for significance testing

### Tick 5
Task: N-fold cross validation

### Tick 6
Task: 3 class naive-bayes classification and kappa score

### Tick 7
Task: Training transition and emission matrices for hidden markov model

### Tick 8
Task: Viterbi algorithm for prediction of hidden states

### Tick 9
Task: Viterbi on dna data and self-training
